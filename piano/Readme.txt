This model was made by HSDev in Blender 2.80 and rendered with the Cycles rendering engine.
It is modelled after Yamaha Arius YDP-164.

Textures included in this archive were downloaded for free off textures.com
The .exr file is the default HDRi used in the Blender lookdev view mode. I just thought that it looks good for this model and thus used it in the render.

Credit to me is not required but would be greatly appreciated. I would also really like to get your feedback and any constructive criticism you might have. Enjoy!
